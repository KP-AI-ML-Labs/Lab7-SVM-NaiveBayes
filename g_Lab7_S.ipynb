    "Our Decision Tree model works, but a good data scientist never settles for the first model that works. We need to explore other modeling strategies. Support Vector Machines (SVM) work by finding the best possible 'line' to separate classes, while Naive Bayes uses probability to make predictions. Let's bring these new players into our team and see how they perform on our 'High-Scoring' prediction task."
