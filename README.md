---

## 📖 Story Point  
Let’s bring in new players. Can SVM or Naive Bayes outperform our simple Decision Tree?  

---

## 🎓 Mapping to Lecture  
- **Topic:** Supervised Learning (SVM, Naive Bayes)  
- **Python Libraries:** `scikit-learn`  
- **Category:** Supervised Learning  

---

## 🧪 In-Class Practical  

**Objective:**  
Compare two new classification algorithms on the high-scoring match prediction problem.  

**Tasks:**  
1. Train **SVM (SVC)** classifier  
2. Train **Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB)**  
3. Compare accuracy vs Decision Tree from Lab 4  

---

## 🏡 Home Task  
- For SVM, experiment with different kernels (`linear`, `rbf`) & C parameter  
- Create a table comparing F1-scores of all models  

---

## ✅ Deliverable  
A summary table comparing Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, and SVM models.
